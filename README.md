# Balinese Dance Video to Image Sequence Converter

A Python project that converts a dataset of Balinese dance videos into image sequences. Each video is converted into frames at 10 frames per second (FPS) and resized to 224x224 pixels. The original dataset structure is preserved, and new CSV files are generated to reflect the updated dataset.
